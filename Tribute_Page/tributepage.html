        <h3>LIFE SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
          Satyendra Nath Bose was an Indian physicist specializing in
          mathematical physics. Bose is well known for his work on quantum
          mathematics in the early 1920s which provided the foundation for the
          Bose-Einstein statistics and the theory of Bose-Einstein condensate. A
          Padma Vibhushan awardee, Bose was one of the greatest scientists of
          India.

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <h4>Career of SN Bose:</h4>
        <p>
          From the year 1916 to 1921, Satyendra Nath Bose was a lecturer in the
          physics department of the University of Calcutta. Along with Saha,
          Bose prepared the first book in English based on from German and
          French translations of original papers on Einstein’s special and
          general relativity in the year 1919. In the year 1921, he joined as
          the Reader in the department of Physics of the then recently founded
          University of Dhaka by the then Vice Chancellor of Calcutta
          University, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee. Bose then set up whole new
          departments, including laboratories to teach advance courses for M. Sc
          and B. Sc honors and taught Thermodynamics as well as Maxwell’s Theory
          of Electromagnetism.

          Bose and Saha together presented several papers in theoretical physics
          and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In the year 1924, while
          working as a reader in Physics department of the Dhaka University,
          Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck’s quantum radiation law without any
          reference to classical physics and using a novel way of counting
          states with identical quantum statistics. Though the paper was not
          accepted at once for publication, Bose sent the article directly to
          Albert Einstein in Germany. Einstein recognizing the importance of the
          paper translated it to German and submitted it on Bose’s behalf to the
          prestigious ‘Zeitschrift fur Physik’. As a result of this, Bose was
          able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography
          laboratories during which he worked with Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie
          and Einstein. Einstein adopted Bose’s idea and extended it to atoms;
          this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which later
          came to be known as the Bose-Einstein condensate, a dense collection
          of bosoms which was later demonstrated to exist by experiment in the
          year 1995. Although more than one Nobel Prize was awarded for research
          related to the concepts of the boson, Bose-Einstein statistics and
          Bose- Einstein condensate, the latest being the 2001 Nobel Prize in
          Physics which was given for advancing the theory of Bose-Einstein
          condensates. Bose though himself was not awarded the Nobel Prize.

          Bose then returned to Dhaka in the year 1926. He was then made head of
          the department of physics and continued teaching and guiding in the
          Dhaka University. He also designed equipments himself for an X-ray
          crystallography laboratory. He also set up laboratories and libraries
          to make the department a center for research in X-ray studies. He also
          published an equation of state for real gases with Megh Nad Saha. Bose
          was also the dean of the faculty of science in Dhaka University till
          the year 1945. When the partition of India became fixed, he returned
          to Calcutta and took up the prestigious Khaira chair and taught at the
          Calcutta University until the year 1956. He also insisted every
          student to design his own equipment using local materials and local
          technicians. He was made professor emeritus upon his retirement. Bose
          later then became the vice Chancellor of Visva-Bharati University in
          Shanti Niketan. He returned to Calcutta University to continue
          research in nuclear physics and complete earlier works in organic
          chemistry. During the following years, he worked in applied research
          such as extraction of helium in hot springs of Bakreswar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bose also became an advisor to the then newly formed Council of
          Scientific and Industrial Research. He was also elected General
          President of the Indian Science Congress. He was also the vice
          president and then the president of the Indian Statistical Institute.
          In the year 1958, he became a fellow of the Royal Society. Bose was
          also nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha. Apart from physics,
          Bose also did some research in biotechnology and literature. He also
          made deep studies in chemistry, geology, zoology, anthropology,
          engineering and other sciences. Being a Bengali, Satyendra Nath Bose
          devoted a lot of time promoting Bengali as a teaching language,
          translating scientific papers into it and promoting the development of
          the region. Bose died on 4th February 1974 in Calcutta.

        <h4>Honors and recognitions of SN Bose:</h4>
        <p>
          In the year 1937, Rabindra Nath Tagore dedicated his only book on
          science ‘Visva-Parichay’ to Satyendra Nath Bose. He was honored with
          India’s second highest civilian award, Padma Vibhushan in the year
          1954 by the Indian Government. In the year 1959, he was appointed as
          the national Professor, the highest honorary in the country as a
          scholar which he held for 15 years. In the year 1986, S. N. Bose
          National Centre for Basic Sciences was established by an Act of
          Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta in honor of
          this world renowned Indian scientist.
