            C++ is a special-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne
            Stroustrup at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ language is very similar to
            C language, and it is so compatible with C that it can run 99% of C
            programs without changing any source of code though C++ is an
            object-oriented programming language, so it is safer and
            well-structured programming language than C.

            C is a structural or procedural oriented programming language which
            is machine-independent and extensively used in various applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            C is the basic programming language that can be used to develop from
            the operating systems (like Windows) to complex programs like Oracle
            database, Git, Python interpreter, and many more. C programming
            language can be called a god's programming language as it forms the
            base for other programming languages. If we know the C language,
            then we can easily learn other programming languages. C language was
            developed by the great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie at the Bell
            Laboratories. It contains some additional features that make it
            unique from other programming languages.
          </p>
          <p>There are some basic differences between C and C++ :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              C is a structural programming language, and it does not support
              classes and objects, while C++ is an object-oriented programming
              language that supports the concept of classes and objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              C supports the structural programming language where the code is
              checked line by line, while C++ is an object-oriented programming
              language that supports the concept of classes and objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              C++ is a superset of C programming language. C++ can run 99% of C
              code but C language cannot run C++ code.
            </li>
            <li>
              C follows the top-down approach, while C++ follows the bottom-up
              approach. The top-down approach breaks the main modules into
              tasks; these tasks are broken into sub-tasks, and so on. The
              bottom-down approach develops the lower level modules first and
              then the next level modules.
            </li>
            <li>
              In C, the data can be easily manipulated by the outsiders as it
              does not support the encapsulation and information hiding while
              C++ is a very secure language, i.e., no outsiders can manipulate
              its data as it supports both encapsulation and data hiding. In C
              language, functions and data are the free entities, and in C++
              language, all the functions and data are encapsulated in the form
              of objects.
            </li>
            <li>C contains 32 keywords, and C++ supports 52 keywords.</li>
            <li>
              C does not provide direct support to the exception handling; it
              needs to use functions that support exception handling. C++
              provides direct support to exception handling by using a try-catch
              block.
            </li>
            <li>
              In C, scanf and printf functions are used for input and output
              operations, respectively, while in C++, cin and cout are used for
              input and output operations, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              C supports calloc() and malloc() functions for the memory
              allocation, and free() function for the memory de-allocation. C++
              supports a new operator for the memory allocation and delete
              operator for the memory de-allocation.
            </li>
            <li>
              C program uses <strong>stdio.h</strong> header file while C++
              program uses <strong>iostream.h</strong> header file.

            A variable is a name of memory location. It is used to store data.
            Its value can be changed and it can be reused many times.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it
            can be easily identified.

          <p>A variable can have alphabets, digits and underscore.</p>
          <p>
            A variable name can start with alphabet and underscore only. It
            can't start with digit.
          </p>
          <p>No white space is allowed within variable name.</p>
          <p>
            A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword e.g. char,
            float etc.
          </p>
          <p>Let's see the syntax to declare a variable:</p>
          <code> int x; float y; char z; </code>
          <p>
            Here, x, y, z are variables and int, float, char are data types.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can also provide values while declaring the variables as given
            below:
          </p>
          <p>Invalid variable names:</p>

            In C++ programming, if statement is used to test the condition.
            There are various types of if statements in C++.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>if statement</li>
            <li>if-else statement</li>
            <li>nested if statement</li>
            <li>if-else-if ladder</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The C++ if statement tests the condition. It is executed if
            condition is true.
          </p>
          <code> if(condition){ //code to be executed } </code>
          <p>
            The C++ if-else statement also tests the condition. It executes if
            block if condition is true otherwise else block is executed.
          </p>
          <code
            >if(condition){ //code if condition is true } else{ //code if
            condition is false }</code
          >
          <p>
            The C++ if-else-if ladder statement executes one condition from
            multiple statements.
          </p>
          <code>
            if(condition1){ //code to be executed if condition1 is true }else
            if(condition2){ //code to be executed if condition2 is true } else
            if(condition3){ //code to be executed if condition3 is true } ...

            The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several
            times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use
            for loop than while or do-while loops.
          </p>
          <p>
            The C++ for loop is same as C/C#. We can initialize variable, check
            condition and increment/decrement value.
          </p>
          <code>
            for(initialization; condition; incr/decr){ //code to be executed }
          </code>
